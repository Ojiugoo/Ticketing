1. Refreshed our memory on the last class
2. Learnt about git branches
3. Open a repository
4. Push our code from the local rpository to the remote repository
   We are adding a new line to the file
I can't believe how annoying codes can be

showing the head changes
adding a new line of text from bugfix master
it is a bright and sunny day
